        <h2>Electricity Access</h2>
        <h5>
          In Malawi, a nation of over 20 million people, more than 80% live
          without the luxury of grid electricity. Yet, even access to
          alternative sustainable energy solutions like solar lamps is hindered
          by financial and logistical challenges. This predicament has given
          rise to cases of inequality and injustices, as households resort to
          using familiar yet costly and hazardous options such as kerosene lamps
          and candles. The daily reliance on these energy sources not only
          drains family finances but also exposes them to the perils of fire
          accidents, respiratory ailments, and eye diseases caused by fumes and
          dim lighting. Our cost-effective solar lamps are poised to
          revolutionize this scenario. By reducing energy expenses, families can
          redirect their funds towards income-generating ventures like
          agriculture, business, and education. At TENERGY, we are committed to
          bridging these logistical and financial barriers to sustainable energy
          technologies. We have deployed network of trained local sales agents
          into various rural communities. This approach ensures the critical
          last mile distribution, all while generating valuable employment
          opportunities for local youths who act as our sales agents To make our
          products accessible to the rural masses, we've adopted a pay-as-you-go
          model. This pricing strategy not only enhances affordability but also
          aligns with the financial realities of our target communities. Through
          these concerted efforts, we're resolutely committed to democratizing
          access to clean energy solutions and fostering positive socio-economic
          transformations in the regions we serve.
